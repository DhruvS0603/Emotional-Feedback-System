# Emotional-Feedback-System
This repository contains Untitled2.ipynb, a supplementary Jupyter Notebook related to emotion detection. This notebook may include exploratory data analysis, alternative models, or additional data processing techniques to enhance emotion classification.<br>

<b>Features</b><br>

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for emotion detection<br>

Preprocessing techniques and feature engineering<br>

Alternative model experimentation<br>

Performance visualization and evaluation<br>

Emotion-based response generation or action suggestions<br>
<br>
<b>What Happens After Emotion Recognition?</b><br>

Once the model classifies an emotion, the notebook may include:<br>

Personalized responses: Generating text-based responses based on detected emotions.<br>

Sentiment-based recommendations: Suggesting music, movies, or activities based on mood.<br>

Alerts or notifications: Sending warnings if negative emotions like stress or sadness are detected.<br>

Visualization of emotion trends: Displaying emotion trends over time to understand behavioral patterns.<br><br>
<b>Usage</b><br>

Run each cell sequentially to execute data processing and model training steps.<br>

Modify hyperparameters or models as needed for experimentation.
<br>
Analyze visualizations to understand model performance.
<br>
Explore the post-recognition actions implemented within the notebook.
